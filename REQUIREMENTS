Backups

Periodically, a backup of the world is made and uploaded to an archive.
Making the backup is not prone to corruption, requiring temporary disabling
of automatic world saving.

Bookmarks

A bookmark is a location annotated with a title and notes. Bookmarks allow
players to plan and locate projects.

Players can issue in-game commands to create and view bookmarks. Viewing a
bookmark reveals its location in the form of coordinates.

MOTD

When a player joins, they will receive the MOTD. The MOTD is configurable by
a server administrator. After editing the MOTD it is not necessary to restart
the server for the changes to take effect.

Rules

When a player first joins, they will receive a written book with the rules in
their inventory. Players can later craft a copy of this book.

The rules are configurable by a server administrator. After editing the rules
it is not necessary to restart the server for the changes to take effect.
